// 20 PROGRAMING QUOTES.//

FIRST-     Programing isn't about what you know; it is about what you can figure out. 
                CHRIS PINE.(LEARN TO PROGRAM)

SECOND-    Code is read much more often than it is written.
                Guido van Rossum.(CREATOR OF PYTHON)

                John Romero.(VIDEO GAME DEVELOPER)

FOURTH-    This was one of the best parts of being a     coder , and an artist: the thrill of being in the middle of creating something delightful. it's like the anticipation of eating freshly baked bread after its aroma fills the room.
                Dr Joy Buolamwini.( UNMASKING AI)

FITH-      Every great developer you know got there by solving problems they were unqualified to solve until they actually did it.
                Patrick McKenzie.(SOFTWARE ENGINEER)

SIX-       The code you write makes you a programmer. The code you delete makes you a good one. The code you don't have to write makes you  a great one.

SEVEN -    Code is like hummor.When you have to explain it, it’s bad.
                Cory House.(REACT AND JAVASCRIPT SPECIALIST)

EIGHT -    The more I study , the more  insatiable do I feel my genius for it to be 
                Ada Lovelace(The world's first computer programmer)         

Nine-      Learning to write programs stretches your mind , and helps you think better, creates a way of thinking about things that I think is helpful in all domains.
                Bill Gates (MICROSOFT CO-FOUNDER) 

TEN-       The function of good software is to make the complex appear to be simple.
                Grady Brooch(CHIEF SCIENTIST FOR SOFTWARE AT IBM RESEARCH) 

ELEVEN -   Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.” 
               Martin Fowler(Refactoring)          

TWELVE -   Give someone a program; you frustrate them for a day; teach them how to program, and you frustrate them for a lifetime 
               David Leinweber.

THIRTNEEN-  Don’t comment bad code – rewrite it 
                Brian Kernighan .
